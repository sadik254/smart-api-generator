A Laravel package to quickly generate API scaffolding — model, migration, controller, and routes — with customizable fields and validation, saving you repetitive work.

---

## Features

- Generate Eloquent Model with fillable properties  
- Generate Migration with nullable or required fields  
- Generate RESTful API Controller with full CRUD methods  
- Auto-append API resource routes with proper controller imports  
- Validation rules auto-generated based on field types and requirements  
- Simple artisan command interface  

---

## Installation

Require the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require saleh/smart-api-generator
```
Laravel will auto-discover the service provider.

## Usage

Run the artisan command and follow the prompts:

```bash
php artisan make:smart-api {ModelName}
```

Example:

```bash
php artisan make:smart-api Post
```

When prompted to enter fields, use the format:

```
title:string:req, body:text, published_at:datetime
```

- Append :req to mark a field as required (validation and migration NOT nullable)

- Omit :req to make the field nullable 

## What it Generates

- Model with $fillable properties
- Migration with specified fields (nullable or required)
- Controller with API resource methods: index, show, store, update, destroy
- Routes added automatically in routes/api.php with proper controller import

## Example Generated Controller Store Validation

```php
$request->validate([
    'title' => 'required|string|max:255',
    'body' => 'nullable|string',
    'published_at' => 'nullable|date',
]);
```
